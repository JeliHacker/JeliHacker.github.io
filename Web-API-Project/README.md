# Web-API
This was a project for CSC 160 Web Data & Design where we worked with an API to create an interactive site. We used a third party Star Wars API to display info about the Star Wars films. NOTE: The API may no longer be functional as it seems to load indefinitely from multiple computers across multiple attempts at different times.

Below is the project assignment document:

Web App for Data Exploration
Due 10-31-19

You will collect data from a web API and present it to your users.  Your APP should make it easy to read through the information.  Successful apps will deal with large datasets that require non-trivial ways to search through the information.  While you should not provide any analysis of your data set, you should make it easy for users to search through the data at multiple different levels of detail.  This ability to "drill down" is an important aspect of interactivity.

Please take some time to explore your dataset in order to ensure that your dataset has enough richness to satisfy the major milestones as possible.  If you don't have a plan to reach all of the milestones with a particular dataset, you should seek another dataset or make due with what you have.  For instance the joke generator API is cool, but you will probably not be able to satisfy all of the requirements using it.


Notes:
You must have a notes web pages connected to your project that details what you did and how you satisfied the rubric.  If the notes pages is missing, you CANNOT earn more than a 70 on this assignment.
Your app should be your own work.  Do not search for existing examples or "borrow" code.  
A community list of known APIs can be found here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zJ6eEr0rVhSuw9ZRVe85cFDJqJ2nopq9vvkxCnqQP8Q/edit?usp=sharing
While you must use web APIs to collect data, you can choose to make live requests or download the dataset(s) for use later.
You must have permission for anything you use.  If you get it from somewhere, note it.  If you created it note it.


Rubrics for each dimension of the assignment.

Information is important, but too much unstructured information is almost as bad as no information.  Provide not only the information, but a way to structure the information that will be easy to use.
No data?
Auto 0 on project
Displays all data
10
Provides one drill down/organize
30
Provides at least two drill down/organize
(Not simply a copy paste of the previous one)
40







No CSS but useable
10
CSS/HTML structure is serviceable
20
Does not cause eyes to bleed.
30
Fully Polished interface(This does not mean overloading it with CSS, it should look professional)
40



Go Beyond - below are some ideas, but feel free to try other things.  You will likely need multiple things to earn 100.  Keep in mind these things should be clever application of code to solve problems, not brute force application of student time.
Incorporate a second set of data alongside your primary dataset.  These should be "integrated" rather than two separate data sets.
10(more)
Create a multipage system that uses "URL objects" to pass parameters between pages
10(more)
Think of something else.  Be sure to discuss it in your notes.
5?,10?
