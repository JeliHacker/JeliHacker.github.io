			<b>I will make at least one GitHub commit every day.</b> In the spirit of Jerry Seinfeld, I will make this my "don't break the chain goal." Today's work showed it's real strength: one commit turned into trying to accomplish one little goal, which led to me finally starting a progress blog. 
			<br>
			Today I:
			<br> Experimented with github pages
			<br> learned about git submodules, which let me store a git project within another git project
			<br> made my first blog post in an index.html file using header and paragraph tags
