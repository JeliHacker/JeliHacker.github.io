				"Good artists copy, but great artists steal." - Picasso
				<br>
				<br>
				A way I've found to get inspired has been to check out the interns at Khan Academy and view their GitHub projects. Today I was exploring a 2019 intern's projects at https://github.com/Arongil. He made a 3D-Engine and a python text game, both of which I would like to replicate. For the python text game, I had the idea to make it like a library, where the player can walk around and checkout books on the shelfs and by reading them they get a few quotes or my reviews of the books.

			<b>I will make at least one GitHub commit every day.</b> In the spirit of Jerry Seinfeld, I will make this my "don't break the chain" goal. Today's work showed it's real strength: one commit turned into trying to accomplish one little goal, which led to me finally starting a progress blog. 
			<br><br>
			Today I:
			<br> Experimented with github pages
			<br> learned about git submodules, which let me store a git project within another git project
			<br> made my first blog post in an index.html file using header and paragraph tags
