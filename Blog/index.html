			Created a codewars account and am working on my first "kata". 
			<br>
			Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.
			<br>
			Examples: spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw" spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test" spinWords( "This is another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"
			<br>
			I've put about 2-3 hours into it so far, and I think I am getting close to a solution.

			Most of my commits today had to do with working on the 3D engine. I am still trying to figure out how it works. I want to improve in Javascript, as well as Python and Swift. These will be my focused languages for the summer.

				"Good artists copy, but great artists steal." - Picasso

				A way I've found to get inspired has been to check out the interns at Khan Academy and view their GitHub projects. Today I was exploring a 2019 intern's projects at https://github.com/Arongil. He made a 3D-Engine and a python text game, both of which I would like to replicate. For the python text game, I had the idea to make it like a library, where the player can walk around and checkout books on the shelfs and by reading them they get a few quotes or my reviews of the books.

			<b>I will make at least one GitHub commit every day.</b> In the spirit of Jerry Seinfeld, I will make this my "don't break the chain" goal. Today's work showed it's real strength: one commit turned into trying to accomplish one little goal, which led to me finally starting a progress blog. 
			<br><br>
			Today I:
			<br> Experimented with github pages
			<br> learned about git submodules, which let me store a git project within another git project
			<br> made my first blog post in an index.html file using header and paragraph tags
